###### 1) ASCII  
ASCII, abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

ASCII is the traditional name for the encoding system; the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) prefers the updated name US-ASCII, which clarifies that this system was developed in the US and based on the typographical symbols predominantly in use there.

ASCII is one of the IEEE milestones.

##### 2)Color  
Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.

By defining a color space, colors can be identified numerically by coordinates, which in 1931 were also named in global agreement with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.) by the International Commission on Illumination. The RGB color space for instance is a color space corresponding to human trichromacy and to the three cone cell types that respond to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564–580 nm (red); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534–545 nm (green); and short-wavelength light, near 420–440 nm (blue). There may also be more than three color dimensions in other color spaces, such as in the CMYK color model, wherein one of the dimensions relates to a color's colorfulness).

### 简单回答下列问题
----------------------------------------------------
###### 1.写出字符“A”,“中”的ASCII码、Unicode码、utf-8编码。
'A' :(ASCII)0x41 (Unicode)0x0041 (utf-8)0x41  
“中” :(ASCII)无 (Unicode) 0x4E2D (utf-8)E4B8AD
###### 2.黄色的RGB值（255,255,0) #FFFF00
###### 3.从网上下载一个BMP的格式图像，用图片编辑工具另存在jpg、png、tiff格式。问三种格式中，哪种格式显示质量好？相对于BMP格式，压缩率是多少？  
答：BMP的格式显示质量好。  
压缩率：  
jpg 4.25%(27.1kb/635kb)  
png  21.26%(135kb/635kb)  
tiff 103.30%(656kb/635kb)  


tiff可以是分层文件和psd格式的差不多 bmp是普通的图片格式   
![bmp](./images/bmp.bmp)

#####  4.Winrar压缩文件是lossless, or lossy 方法？
Winrar压缩文件是无损压缩，lossless
