## 第九周作业
#### 1、Program with machine language according to the following c.
（1） LOD #1 -> STO X -> LOD X -> ADD #3 -> STO Y ->HLT  
00000100 00000001  
00010000 00000011  
（2）I.Fetch Instruction 从主存中取指令，得到机器码 （PC+4)  
II.Decode Instuction 指令译码, 根据指令格式分析指令作用  
III. 从寄存器中取值  
IV. 在ALU算术逻辑运算单元中进行运算操作  
V. ALU运算结果返回寄存器或储存到内存中  
VI.在PC+4处执行下一条指令  
（3）IR（Instuction Register）指令寄存器：是临时放置从内存里面取得的程序指令的寄存器，用于存放当前从主存储器读出的正在执行的一条指令  
PC（Program counter）程序计数器，用来计数的，指示指令存储的存放位置  
ACC（Accumulator）累加器。专门用来存放操作数或运算结果。  
（4）用于存放八位二进制数的寄存器

#### 2、简答题
（1）机器指令、数据  
（2）可以  
（3）例如ADD  #3 00010000 00000011 其中前八位为指令码 后八位为数值（有时候也可以是个地址） 其中前八位的第四位是寻址模式（1表示后八位操作数为数值，0表示为地址） 前八位的后四位是操作码指示不同的命令

#### 3、解释一下词汇
###### 1、汇编语言（Assembly Language）
汇编语言（assembly language）是一种用于电子计算机、微处理器、微控制器或其他可编程器件的低级语言，亦称为符号语言。在汇编语言中，用助记符（Mnemonics）代替机器指令的操作码，用地址符号（Symbol）或标号（Label）代替指令或操作数的地址。在不同的设备中，汇编语言对应着不同的机器语言指令集，通过汇编过程转换成机器指令。普遍地说，特定的汇编语言和特定的机器语言指令集是一一对应的,不同平台之间不可直接移植
An assembly (or assembler) language,often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.

##### 2、编译（Compiler）
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.[1] A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers. 

###### 3、命令式语言（Imperative programming）
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result. 

##### 4、函数编程语言（Functional programming）
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming. 

##### 5、过程式编程（Procedural programming）
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC.Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
